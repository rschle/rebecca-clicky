# Stranger Clicks

Description
------------

The "Stranger Clicks" app is a simple game testing the user's memory. The app uses the dynamic and seamless framework and functionality provided by React. The concept of the app is quite simple: on the page is a collection of twelve cards of characters from the hit Netflix series "Stranger Things". The user has to click on characters that they have not clicked on yet, and after each click, the cards are shuffled to add an extra challenge. If the user clicks on a card more than once, she loses and the score reverts back to zero. So give it a shot, don't be a mouth-breathing, demagorgon, and remember which cards you've already clicked!
